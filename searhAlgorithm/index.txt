Linear Search pseudocode : 
    1. start at the first element in the array and move towards the last.
    2. At each element though, check if the element is equal to the target element.
    3. if element found, return the index of the element.
    4. if element not found, return -1.

Binary Search: only worked on a sorted array
    Binary Search pseudocode : 
        1.if the array is empty, return -1 as the element cannot be found.
        2. if the array has elements, find the middle element in the array. if target is equal to the middle element, return the middle element index
        3. if target is less than the middle element, binary search left half of the array.
        4. if target is greater than the middle element, binary search right half of the array.
