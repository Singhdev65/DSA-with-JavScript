Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Recursion is when a funtion calls itself.

important points about recursion: 
    1. Every recursive solution need to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
    2. Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to  faster solution.

Tips for recursive problem:
    1. Figure out how to break down the problem into smaller versions of the same problem.
    2. identify the base case for recursion.
